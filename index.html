				<p>I was born in Wuhan, China on November 24, 1991. My family and I migrated to the United States when I was one. First I lived in Oxford, Mississippi because my mother's friends lived there. Then I lived in Memphis, Tennessee and then San Diego, CA. Now I lived here in San Diego at Ivy Hill Drive for 20 years and made many friends during elementary school, middle school, and high school.</p>

					<p>After graduating from high school in June 2010 I attended college at UC Riverside. My major was in electrical engineering. At UC Riverside I enjoyed talking with roommates, dormmates, and other classmates about school related things. I graduated with a bachelors degree in December 2014. Afterwards I worked part time at SDSU as a research assistant for a NSF project from May 2015 to May 2016.</p>
